# UrbanGardening
*Software Repository for the Urban Gardening Project*

## What is this Project about?
Build a Hydroponic System for growing plants, which will be controlled by a raspberry pi. The System will have various sensors and Actors (Pumps) to control the state of the system. The Pi will host a website, which will display the current status, measurement data, camera image and controls to manipulate the system. 

## Stages
**Stage 1:** Get the Website up and running  
**Stage 2:** Order the Sensors and tweak the controller  
**Stage 3:** Buy all the Hardware and build the System  
**Stage 4:** Grow Stuff!
